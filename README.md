Flash!

Flash was designed to create a digital studying space for students in a digital age. This app allows individuals to create an account where they can make personalized flash card decks, update these decks, and search for premade sets of cards. Our site has three levels of authorization--an Admin has the ability to view all users and all decks of cards while logged in. They can monitor the site and ensure that users maintan decency in their creation of cards. The next level of authorization is a user--these individuals have access to all decks, but can only update and delete their own decks. The final level of authorization is a guest. We wanted our app to accessible to individuals who are just visiting the site for the first time. We provided a search bar on our splash page, where guest can search various subjects for sample decks.

For this app we used: Express, Node, Knex, PostgresQL, API integration, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS.
